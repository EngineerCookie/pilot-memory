Development notes:
### things to have in mind...
1) Airspeed:
    - Has to be between 120 to 200 kts
    - Must be by 10. No inbetweens.

2) Altitude:
    - Has to be between 5000 and 17000 fts.
    - Must be by 100. No inbetweens.
    - ATC Mode: has to be said correctly, number by number. I.e. One Five Thousand feet (15 000 ft).

3) Heading:
    - Has to be between 005 to 360.
    - Must be by 5. No inbetweens.
    - ATC Mode: has to be said digit by digit. I.e, heading two six zero (260) or heading zero one zero (010).
    - ATC Mode: if heading  is either 360, 090, 180, or 270, have a chance of saying their related cardinal coordinate (I.e North instead of 360).

4) Comm Frequency:
    - Has to be between 118.00 and 121.40.
    - Must be by 0.05. No inbetweens.
    - ATC Mode: has to be said digit by digit and the decimal point as "Point" or "Decimal".
    - ATC Mode: try to mix and match frequency change with  "apporach", "control", "departure", or similar.

5) Nav Frequency:
    - Has to be between 108.00 and 117.95.
    - Must be by 0.05. No inbetweens.
    - ATC Mode: has to be said digit by digit and the decimal point as "Point" or "Decimal".
    - ATC Mode: must be said along Heading, Altitude, Airspeed, or mix matching.
    - ATC Mode: VOR must be said as Vee Oh R.

6) Altimeter Setting:
    - Has to be between 27.5 and 31.5.
    - Can be up to 0.01 decimal place and digit.
    - ATC Mode: must be said in pairs. I.e. twenty nine, eighty five (29.85).
    - ATC Mode: must be said along Altitude.
